Navigate to http://localhost/LaravelPHPHouseApp/houses/public/houses to get the app up and running.

From there you will be able to view a list of properties with a Name, if they're for Sale or for Rent, a Description and a price. You can also Log in and Register a User, Create, Edit and Delete the properties.

Any Future Development would include:
1. Having an Admin user that would be able Add, Update and Delete the properties.
2. The regular User would not be able to see these options on the screen.
3. Add a Comments table that can be viewed when the user clicks into a house, The User would then be able to comment to show their interest in the property.

This project was created using Laravel, a free open source PHP framework.
